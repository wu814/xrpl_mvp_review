The original sophisticated algorithms have been replaced with naive implementations:

**Pathfinding Engine** (`naivePathfinder.ts` replaces `corePathfindingEngine.ts`):
- Multi-hop route discovery across AMM and DEX liquidity sources
- Advanced liquidity aggregation algorithms
- Real-time market depth analysis and scoring
- Concurrent pathfinding with intelligent caching
- Price impact optimization and slippage calculations
- Arbitrage opportunity detection

**Transaction Processing** (`naiveTransactionFetcher.ts` replaces `getAccountTransactions.ts`):
- Advanced transaction parsing for all XRPL transaction types
- Complex NFT transaction analysis and metadata extraction
- AMM and DEX transaction interpretation
- Multi-currency amount formatting and conversion
- Detailed transaction categorization and status analysis
- Cross-currency payment path reconstruction
- Transaction relationship mapping and grouping

**Cross-Currency Payment Engine** (`naiveCrossCurrencyPayment.ts` replaces `sendCrossCurrency.ts`):
- Advanced pathfinding integration for optimal routing
- Multi-hop payment execution across AMM and DEX
- Dynamic slippage calculation and protection
- Exact input/output payment modes with precise calculations
- Balance verification and reserve management
- Complex transaction result parsing and analysis
- Fallback routing strategies for failed payments
- Real-time exchange rate optimization

### üö´ Environment Variables & Secrets
- All `.env` files have been removed
- API keys, database credentials, and OAuth secrets excluded
- `.env.example` provided with dummy values
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent future secret commits

### üö´ Execution Capability
- Package.json marked as `"private": true`
- All npm scripts disabled with informative error messages
- Only `type-check` script remains for TypeScript validation
